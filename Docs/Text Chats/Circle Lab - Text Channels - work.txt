Each DAO requires a add, modify, delete, find(Object), findAll function

[01-Apr-20 03:42 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone The final ERD is online and I have added the DAO's for people to start work on. I will aim to get the database up and running as soon as possible and I will let you know once the work is complete.

[01-Apr-20 04:39 PM] Emma12812#7942
sounds good! thanks

[01-Apr-20 04:39 PM] Blnkspc#9267
I am just working on the fake data now.

[01-Apr-20 04:39 PM] Blnkspc#9267
I will then be able to load the database.

[23-Apr-20 10:37 AM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone Can I please ask you to delete branch's that you are not using and are no longer needed... This can be done using these two commands... ```git branch -d test``` to delete the local branch and then ```git push origin --delete test``` to delete the remote branch that is the one on GitHub. Please delete both and make sure you are only deleting your own thank you.

[23-Apr-20 10:37 AM] Blnkspc#9267
You can be in any branch to run these commands and as always please be careful.

[23-Apr-20 10:45 AM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone Can I please ask everyone to do this before tomorrow thanks.

[23-Apr-20 11:45 AM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone the formatting of the risk analysis table is all wrong and i dont know how to fix it

[23-Apr-20 11:47 AM] Emma12812#7942
@Blnkspc trying to run the first command to delete the branch locally and it says the branch is not found

[23-Apr-20 11:50 AM] JoshuaAB#9254
Just run the second one

[23-Apr-20 11:53 AM] Blnkspc#9267
@Emma12812 what Josh said.

[23-Apr-20 11:54 AM] Emma12812#7942

[23-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Emma12812#7942

[23-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Emma12812#7942
we discussed it with ..... (cant think what to call him)

[23-Apr-20 12:49 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
A client maybe

[23-Apr-20 01:04 PM] Emma12812#7942

[23-Apr-20 01:17 PM] morochin#2472
i gotta do it! üëç

[23-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh okay no worries

[23-Apr-20 01:18 PM] morochin#2472

[23-Apr-20 01:18 PM] morochin#2472
3 would be enough?

[23-Apr-20 01:18 PM] Emma12812#7942
can you post a screenshoot of the example so i can see it

[23-Apr-20 01:18 PM] Emma12812#7942
I dont mind helping you develop it later if youd like?

[23-Apr-20 01:19 PM] morochin#2472

[23-Apr-20 01:19 PM] Emma12812#7942

want to call at 3pm and get that sorted?

[23-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Emma12812#7942
or i can do late tonight at like 10pm ? which ever is easier

[23-Apr-20 01:20 PM] morochin#2472
any time is good for me

[23-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Emma12812#7942
3pm then? ?

[23-Apr-20 01:21 PM] morochin#2472
sure!!

[23-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Emma12812#7942
awesome

[23-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone could I also ask 1 person to talk about the user guide and 1 person for the developer guide within the presentation as I do not know much about these obviously

[23-Apr-20 02:32 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone do we think we need to make a test plan for absolutely everything? or just one with a variety of tests in to show we can do it

[23-Apr-20 02:39 PM] Emma12812#7942
@mkhtop have you got a list of all of the names of each webpage that I could have

[23-Apr-20 03:26 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone it is going to be quite difficult do these tests without actually using the program as we are not fully sure on the layout etc of the program so cannot write the test actions.

[23-Apr-20 03:40 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Why is there still a folder in the dev branch?

[23-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh shit forgot to take the files out the folder

[23-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Emma12812#7942
i guess we can just take files out the folder and push it back to dev

[23-Apr-20 03:41 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
But the folder would still be there

[23-Apr-20 03:42 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
The files would just be in 2 places

[23-Apr-20 03:42 PM] Emma12812#7942
not if we delete the folder

[23-Apr-20 03:45 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
There are methods incorrectly named and the input should just be $newPerson. Php doesn't specify variable types

[23-Apr-20 03:50 PM] Emma12812#7942
Oh fuck üòÇ

[23-Apr-20 03:50 PM] Emma12812#7942
I'll have to sort it when I'm home as I'm out atm

[23-Apr-20 03:50 PM] Emma12812#7942
It worked when being tested

[23-Apr-20 03:51 PM] Emma12812#7942
So I don't think it's a huge issue

[23-Apr-20 03:54 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It may pass the tests but the camel case naming scheme, standard method names (add, modify, find, delete), unit testing (each dao/dto) is all there to make putting everything together easier and quicker. I only have until next Friday to receive everyone's work and piece it all together

[23-Apr-20 03:55 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I have to write each method in the service facade and test them too

[23-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Emma12812#7942
Okay I'll sort it when I'm back can I just push it straight to branch

[23-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Emma12812#7942
Dev I mean

[23-Apr-20 03:57 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I'm not sure

[23-Apr-20 03:58 PM] Emma12812#7942
I don't see why it would be a bad thing

[23-Apr-20 03:59 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
You'll have to message Matt about it

[23-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Emma12812#7942
I'll sort it later

[23-Apr-20 04:04 PM] Emma12812#7942
What exactly do you want me to change

[23-Apr-20 04:06 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Remove files from their folders.
Rename methods (Remove underscores, use camel case)
Change input variables to just have the variable name.

[23-Apr-20 04:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
There's not enough time for testing now, so don't worry about that

[23-Apr-20 04:42 PM] Emma12812#7942
how do you want me to call insertDiseasePersonLinkDTO to?

[23-Apr-20 04:43 PM] Emma12812#7942

[23-Apr-20 04:54 PM] Emma12812#7942

[23-Apr-20 06:26 PM] Emma12812#7942
Tried to make the pull request on my new code (its in EmmasCode2) but its erroring because files are in dev

[23-Apr-20 06:39 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone who is able to talk about the user guide and developer guide for tomorrow?

[23-Apr-20 06:53 PM] mkhtop#4904
I can talk about it

[23-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahahha you only need to say like 20 seconds of info on it ahah

[23-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
which one are you doing user guide or developer ?

[23-Apr-20 06:55 PM] mkhtop#4904
I'll be talking about the user guide, I think Matt and Josh are talking about the developer guide

[23-Apr-20 06:55 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh okay awesome

[23-Apr-20 08:59 PM] mkhtop#4904
Demo is ready to go for the morning
feel free to checkout the gui branch and run it on you own machine to have a look, you may just need to set up a php interpreter on phpstorm
login is admin with password admin
if you wanna try and search for a person search for robin or wright or robin wright (not case sensitive)
you can add a prescription to robin with up to 3 drugs (slight issue with quantity but nothing big just have only one choice of quantity)
you can also search for robin under prescriptions which should give you a list of the prescriptions
ill be online at half 8 if anyone finds anything broken/needs changing

[24-Apr-20 08:26 AM] Emma12812#7942
amazing !! @JoshuaAB @Blnkspc who can speak about the developer guide today

[24-Apr-20 08:52 AM] mkhtop#4904
@JoshuaAB if you do a pull before the demo, I've just added functionality to the delete prescription button so should remove it from the list

[24-Apr-20 08:52 AM] JoshuaAB#9254
Cool cool

[24-Apr-20 08:53 AM] JoshuaAB#9254
Hopefully Matt can talk about it as I'll do the demo

[24-Apr-20 08:53 AM] Emma12812#7942

[24-Apr-20 08:54 AM] Emma12812#7942
i think we only have 10 minutes for the whole presentation ahah

Now we can just focus on getting the rest of the implementation complete

[24-Apr-20 10:37 AM] JoshuaAB#9254
Yeah, I've created a checklist of daos left to implement and I'll start working through them 1 by 1

[24-Apr-20 10:37 AM] Emma12812#7942

[24-Apr-20 02:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
how are we finding locations in the application

[24-Apr-20 02:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
by id, type? anything else

[24-Apr-20 02:06 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
And by template I think

[24-Apr-20 02:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
okay awesome

[24-Apr-20 02:06 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Your findMatchingLocations method looks so strange

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
i used it in craigs

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I think I have it sorted though

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I'll test it soon xD

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
it can find things by looking for anything

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
so it can search using name and type for example

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
and it looks at letters not whole words so it uses contains()

[24-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
but the php method for contains() ahah

[24-Apr-20 02:08 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Okay

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
updates should be done

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
just uploading

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
you happy for me to update to dev?

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
We have no choice

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Matt has to take the rule off

[24-Apr-20 02:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
okay cool just doing it

[24-Apr-20 02:20 PM] Emma12812#7942

[24-Apr-20 02:20 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thank you

[24-Apr-20 02:20 PM] Emma12812#7942
i have no clue where i got my information from originally ?!?!? so strange

[24-Apr-20 02:23 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I can't see the change to locationDTO

[24-Apr-20 02:23 PM] Emma12812#7942
i had to push that seperately

[24-Apr-20 02:23 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I can see the change to the DAO and DTOTest

[24-Apr-20 02:23 PM] Emma12812#7942
pull again ahhaa

[24-Apr-20 02:24 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I have

[24-Apr-20 02:24 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
and I'm looking on GitHub

[24-Apr-20 02:24 PM] Emma12812#7942
let me check again

[24-Apr-20 02:25 PM] Emma12812#7942
check now?

[24-Apr-20 02:25 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Now I see it üòÑ

[24-Apr-20 02:25 PM] Emma12812#7942
pheww

[25-Apr-20 11:34 AM] JoshuaAB#9254
Hey @Emma12812  could I get you to add a find by object to each of the linking tables please. It would make checking whether a specific record already exists much easier.

[25-Apr-20 12:13 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It allows to me check if a record exists before attempting to delete/ update or add new

[25-Apr-20 12:15 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It should look like this

[25-Apr-20 01:48 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Also, in diseaseSymptomLinkDAO. The modifyDiseaseSymptomLinkDTO method has treatment in the query rather than symptom. That's an hour of my life gone trying to find why it wasn't modifying the record xD

[25-Apr-20 01:53 PM] morochin#2472
Not done a great job reviewing  have I? üòÖ

[25-Apr-20 02:10 PM] mkhtop#4904
@juan i have reviewed your code, alot of same things so sorry if seems repetitive

[25-Apr-20 02:12 PM] morochin#2472
no prob! appreciate the feedback let me fix them up

[25-Apr-20 02:30 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@Emma12812 In diseaseTreatmentLinkDAO, modify link method. Could you swap the old and updated links around because they are the other way around in the other linking tables you've made

[25-Apr-20 03:57 PM] Emma12812#7942
@JoshuaAB will fix that now

[25-Apr-20 03:57 PM] Emma12812#7942
can you push all your code to github so i can pull the most uptodate before working on it

[25-Apr-20 03:59 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I haven't edited the files from dev. Just update them and I can grab them from dev as I need them

[25-Apr-20 03:59 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh okay awesome

[25-Apr-20 04:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
all done and uploading

[25-Apr-20 04:10 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thank you

[25-Apr-20 04:28 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
You have an extra curly bracket at the end of diseasePersonLinkDAO

[25-Apr-20 04:30 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
And there is a missing $ on modifyDiseaseTreatmentLinkDTO

[25-Apr-20 04:50 PM] Emma12812#7942
Done

[25-Apr-20 05:04 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
There were some more errors, but I'm just gonna upload the fixes

[25-Apr-20 05:11 PM] Emma12812#7942
okay

[25-Apr-20 10:32 PM] morochin#2472
@JoshuaAB finally finish going 1 by 1 in each change from the review if u find anything u want me to change or any issues let me know i also added the find by object function u wanted in both my links!

[26-Apr-20 12:41 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@morochin  Thank you, I'll get onto those soon

[26-Apr-20 12:43 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@Emma12812 I'm not entirely sure if either a) I don't understand how to use findMatchingLocations or b) it doesn't do anything üòÖ

[26-Apr-20 12:51 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
locationDAO findById breaks if you search for an ID that's not in the database. Should check if count = 1 before contructing an object to return

[26-Apr-20 12:58 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@mkhtop Disease and Symptom DAO neither need the variable types in their functions' inputs

[26-Apr-20 01:01 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Also update symptom/disease should be modify symptom/disease

[26-Apr-20 01:13 PM] mkhtop#4904
No worries will update that asap

[26-Apr-20 01:13 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Cheers üôÇ

[26-Apr-20 01:24 PM] Emma12812#7942
What do you want me to change find matching location to instead?

[26-Apr-20 01:25 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Just before making the locationDTO, check that the query count == 1

[26-Apr-20 01:25 PM] JoshuaAB#9254

Kinda like this

[26-Apr-20 01:27 PM] Emma12812#7942
Okay I'll sort it after I've had my lunch

[26-Apr-20 01:28 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thank you üôÇ

[26-Apr-20 01:48 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@mkhtop findSymptom/Disease should also check count == 1 before constructing objects

[26-Apr-20 02:15 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
üòÇ  Also symptomDTO setId() actually sets the name, not the ID! That took me a while to figure out why getName was returning a number

[26-Apr-20 02:16 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
For reference findSymptom/Disease should look like this I think

[26-Apr-20 02:16 PM] JoshuaAB#9254

[26-Apr-20 04:08 PM] mkhtop#4904
checked my commit, i only removed a random & on drugDAO so should be fine

[26-Apr-20 04:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
Sorry I had to pop to the shops will work on it soon

[26-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Emma12812#7942
should be updated now

[26-Apr-20 06:22 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thank you everyone. Just had dinner, I'll start working on it again now for a bit

[27-Apr-20 10:03 AM] Emma12812#7942
@mkhtop @JoshuaAB I think me and Juan will need help with the test plan as I am unsure on how we carry out certain tasks within the application so cannot fill out the actions part of the test plan if that makes sense

[27-Apr-20 10:19 AM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone are we calling today?

[27-Apr-20 10:42 AM] mkhtop#4904

https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/~assign211/PointsOfInterest/

[27-Apr-20 01:14 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@morochin an I've already changed some naming issues. Could you change findAllDrugTreatmentLinkByPrescription to findAllDrugTreatmentLinkByTreatment

[27-Apr-20 01:18 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Also some of your functions in the linking tables are written like this 
($newDrugTreatmentLink->getDrug() != null)  && $newDrugTreatmentLink->getTreatment() != null)

[27-Apr-20 01:18 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
But they should be like this

[27-Apr-20 01:18 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
($newDrugTreatmentLink->getDrug() != null && $newDrugTreatmentLink->getTreatment() != null)

[27-Apr-20 01:20 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
There is also a random return false on line 61 in DrugTreatmentLinkDAO

[27-Apr-20 01:21 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
And line 62 has a } which cuts of half of the class

[27-Apr-20 01:22 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Line 87 there is an 1 too many ) after $row["prescription"]

[27-Apr-20 01:29 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I'm assuming all of these points will also be true for drugPrescription DAO/DTO if you copy and pasted them

[27-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Emma12812#7942
@morochin are you available to fix these now?

[27-Apr-20 01:30 PM] morochin#2472
Crap... give me 30 min I am just about to take a shower

[27-Apr-20 01:31 PM] Emma12812#7942
thanks!

[27-Apr-20 01:31 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
addDrugTreatmentLink calls setID but drugTreatmentLinkDTO doesn't have an ID

[27-Apr-20 01:32 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
drugTreatmentLinkDAO says $row["prescription"] rather than $row["treatment"] row 87

[27-Apr-20 01:33 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Actually it happens a few times throughout

[27-Apr-20 01:33 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
5 times altogether

[27-Apr-20 01:34 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I think I may have to rewrite these myself soon

[27-Apr-20 01:35 PM] morochin#2472
Jezz

[27-Apr-20 01:35 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I finally got it to compile and add a drugTreatmentDTO

[27-Apr-20 01:44 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
drugTreatmentLinkDAO line 58 says where = drug = ? rather than where drug = ?

[27-Apr-20 01:45 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Also line 35 does the same

[27-Apr-20 01:57 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Line 33 calls getId but again drugTreatmentLinkDTO doesn't have an ID

[27-Apr-20 01:57 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
if ($removedDrugTreatmentLink != null && $removedDrugTreatmentLink->getDrug() != null && $removedDrugTreatmentLink->getTreatment() != null)

[27-Apr-20 01:58 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
That should be line 33

[27-Apr-20 02:00 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
DrugTreatmentDAO has now been tested

[27-Apr-20 02:02 PM] morochin#2472
right i am back gonna start doing the changes

[27-Apr-20 02:05 PM] morochin#2472
i just did a pull on dev

[27-Apr-20 02:06 PM] morochin#2472
and it says that i am ehind

oh god I have no clue what to do to fix that

[27-Apr-20 02:06 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Did you make changes before doing the pull?

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] morochin#2472
no

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] morochin#2472
just oppened the file

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] morochin#2472
genuenly

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] Emma12812#7942
think you have to delete the folder and reclone?

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Then reclone

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
yeah

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] morochin#2472
will do

[27-Apr-20 02:07 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It's probably because I pushed a  couple of smalle changes already

[27-Apr-20 02:11 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
line 16/17 missing { to start the if statement

[27-Apr-20 02:12 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
This is drugPrescriptionDAO now

[27-Apr-20 02:13 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Also you are missing a } at the end of each method meaning they never close and cannot be called. findByObject is fine though

[27-Apr-20 02:14 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
The if statement for addDrugPrescriptionLink has a random ] in it

[27-Apr-20 02:15 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
And it has a random ) which close the if statement input too soon

[27-Apr-20 02:15 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
modifyDrugPrescriptionLink has the same problems

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] morochin#2472
sweet lord

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] morochin#2472
xD!

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] morochin#2472
right

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I bet these are coming faster than you can fix them

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] morochin#2472
where do i start

[27-Apr-20 02:16 PM] morochin#2472
they are indeed hahahah

[27-Apr-20 02:17 PM] morochin#2472
right i recloned the repository now

[27-Apr-20 02:17 PM] morochin#2472
should i start on drugtreatment link?

[27-Apr-20 02:18 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Yeah, because I've looked through all of that one

[27-Apr-20 02:19 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I now have an error which I don't understand

[27-Apr-20 02:21 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Nevermind that was a problem on my end

[27-Apr-20 02:22 PM] morochin#2472
right

[27-Apr-20 02:22 PM] morochin#2472
i am fixing them as we go give me 2 secs

[27-Apr-20 02:54 PM] morochin#2472
right drug prescription should be completely the same now as the one u uploaded

[27-Apr-20 02:55 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Just person, disease, appointment and reports to go

[27-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
awesome !!! thanks for getting this all done @JoshuaAB

[27-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
worst comes to worst we dont need to worry about reports

[27-Apr-20 04:43 PM] morochin#2472
@JoshuaAB oppened them in php storm the brackets problem should be all sorted in all of them following the one u did it should be good to go now from my side but since is likely to have another error somewhere let me know if i can do anything else

[28-Apr-20 01:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone is everyone available to meet tomorrow at 11am

[28-Apr-20 01:23 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Yeah

[28-Apr-20 02:05 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
@Emma12812 Person DAO/DTO should include an isactive attribute

[28-Apr-20 02:06 PM] Emma12812#7942
okay

[28-Apr-20 02:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
omg ive just realised ive been going off of my old database that i made origionally

[28-Apr-20 02:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
no wonder my stuff was wrong!

[28-Apr-20 02:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
Sorry!!!!

[28-Apr-20 02:10 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Oh xD

[28-Apr-20 02:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
fixing person now

[28-Apr-20 02:11 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thanks üôÇ

[28-Apr-20 02:16 PM] Emma12812#7942
added is active, made it so a person cannot be added unless isactive is equal to one and added isactive to all other functions etc

[28-Apr-20 02:17 PM] Emma12812#7942
should be uploaded

[28-Apr-20 02:17 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Thanks, I'll get that pulled

[28-Apr-20 02:44 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
After 2 hours I still can't add a person

[28-Apr-20 02:44 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I'll take a break and come back to it

[28-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Emma12812#7942
wtfff what error is it giving you?

[28-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Emma12812#7942
i was definitely able to add test people into the database

[28-Apr-20 02:45 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It's returning null so I probs fucked it at the service facade layer

[28-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Emma12812#7942
if you want you can send over the code and i could try look

[28-Apr-20 02:48 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I've pushed it to the gui branch if you want to have a look

[28-Apr-20 02:51 PM] Emma12812#7942
hmm want me to create a find by username within person so its easier to check if someone in the database with that username already exists?

[28-Apr-20 02:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
is it because you dont have triple equals?

[28-Apr-20 02:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
```php
if($personObj != null && $personObj->getId() == null && $personObj->getFirstName() != null && $personObj->getLastName() != null && $personObj->getDob() != null && ($personObj->getGender() == 0 || $personObj->getGender() == 1)
      && $personObj->getEmail() != null && $personObj->getPhone() != null && $personObj->getAddress() != null && $personObj->getRole() != null && $personObj->getUsername() != null && $personObj->getPassword() != null
      && ($personObj->getIsactive() == 0 || $personObj->getIsactive() == 1))
```

[28-Apr-20 02:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
in that ?

[28-Apr-20 03:00 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It would be useful. I tried triple === also

[28-Apr-20 03:00 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Tried chaning a lot of things

[28-Apr-20 03:00 PM] Emma12812#7942
other than that i couldnt see anything blaringly obvious to be wrong üò¶

```
Each of the phases should evidence your understanding of tasks and activities required but emphasis will be on what you have done, why, what learning or lessons you derived among other things for every phases of the SDLC. For example, the maintenance phase for your group comprises of the developer's guide, user guide and presentation documents. While I will expect you to give a synopsis to demonstrate an understanding of the three documents (i.e., purpose, contents and context), emphasis will be on the presentation document which you have worked on (as you have advised in the group's demo last week) in that phase. Simply put, your report is a brief introduction of all activities within the phase then more details on your contribution (what, how and why) and its impacts on the entire activities of the phase you are addressing. I hope this helps?

[04-May-20 10:12 AM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone what branch do i go to to run the program

[04-May-20 10:13 AM] mkhtop#4904
if you checkout the gui branch you should be able to run it from there

[04-May-20 10:14 AM] Emma12812#7942
awesome thanks

[04-May-20 10:15 AM] Blnkspc#9267

[04-May-20 10:19 AM] mkhtop#4904

[04-May-20 10:20 AM] Emma12812#7942

[04-May-20 10:21 AM] mkhtop#4904

[04-May-20 10:21 AM] Emma12812#7942
okay

[04-May-20 12:45 PM] mkhtop#4904
just sorting out deactive location fyi

[04-May-20 12:45 PM] mkhtop#4904
but should work in same way as deactive person

[04-May-20 12:47 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh okay

[04-May-20 12:47 PM] Emma12812#7942
so its not delete its deactivate ?

[04-May-20 12:47 PM] mkhtop#4904
yeah thought to keep it consistent with person

[04-May-20 12:47 PM] Emma12812#7942
sounds good!

[04-May-20 12:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
test plan done

[04-May-20 01:39 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Just a couple of small things really

[04-May-20 01:40 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
The test plan is good. Just on 1.14 maybe give a postcode to search for.

[04-May-20 01:40 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
In the program, how do I reactivate a person/location?

[04-May-20 01:41 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
And searching for a diagnosis with a non existing symptom gives an error

[04-May-20 01:41 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Other than that all good

[04-May-20 02:06 PM] mkhtop#4904
We havent accounted for reactivating, it was more to stop the database from breaking if one was removed

[04-May-20 02:08 PM] Emma12812#7942
Yeah I don't thinks it's something we should bother adding now

[04-May-20 03:01 PM] Emma12812#7942
@JoshuaAB  let me know when you push the test plan to docs completed and ill make that change

[04-May-20 03:01 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I haven't edited it at all, so feel free to go ahead

[04-May-20 03:21 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh okay awesome

[04-May-20 03:23 PM] Emma12812#7942
ahh i dont have a postcode on that one because if i did the test plan would only work once. I have just changed it to make it clearer hopefully

[04-May-20 06:39 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone I just wanted to check that you are all OK and that no one is in need of any help at all?

[04-May-20 06:41 PM] mkhtop#4904
@Blnkspc all good thank you, unless you can get me fibre optic that would be great üòÇ

[04-May-20 06:42 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Who is your ISP?

[04-May-20 06:42 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Ill see what I can do ü§£

[04-May-20 06:54 PM] Emma12812#7942
Think everything is alright now that the implementation is done

[04-May-20 09:42 PM] mkhtop#4904
@everyone user guides are complete for both medical practitioners and patients, there just needs to be a modification to the url for the system

[04-May-20 09:42 PM] Emma12812#7942
amazing !!!!

[04-May-20 09:42 PM] Emma12812#7942
as soon as everything is merged into master i can send it over to sam to set up on the website

[05-May-20 12:09 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone Can I please ask you all to confirm work has been completed before closing the repo? @mkhtop apart from the issue you are having with the URL.

[05-May-20 12:09 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
Mine is completed

[05-May-20 12:09 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Completed please go ahead

[05-May-20 12:20 PM] mkhtop#4904
My work is completed (minus the user guide) just noticed there is still a branch i need to delete, did you want me to do this now?

[05-May-20 12:22 PM] Emma12812#7942
Mines all done apart from the fact I have one extra branch but I thought they were just being deleted snyway. Has the test plan been carried out fine?

[05-May-20 12:25 PM] Blnkspc#9267
> My work is completed (minus the user guide) just noticed there is still a branch i need to delete, did you want me to do this now?
@mkhtop that is fine I will deal with it.

[05-May-20 12:25 PM] Emma12812#7942
Also I don't think we should delete the discord as it can be used as evidence in our report and it's easier to take screenshots directly from it

[05-May-20 12:26 PM] Blnkspc#9267
> Mines all done apart from the fact I have one extra branch but I thought they were just being deleted snyway. Has the test plan been carried out fine?
@Emma12812 Me and Josh will deal with all branches now.

[05-May-20 12:26 PM] Emma12812#7942
Awesome

[05-May-20 12:28 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Also I don't think we should delete the discord as it can be used as evidence in our report and it's easier to take screenshots directly from it

@Emma all chats are being exported and put into the final artifact anyway so you will be able to pull it out of there.

[05-May-20 12:32 PM] Emma12812#7942
It's an easy way to contact each other if needed though

[05-May-20 12:41 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Yes but after the repo is closed we are no longer a group.

[05-May-20 01:09 PM] Emma12812#7942
Okay maybe just keep it till we get our grades incase there are issues with the server that's all I'm concerned about

[05-May-20 01:11 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Sounds good

[05-May-20 01:12 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Just need the go ahead from @morochin

[05-May-20 01:12 PM] morochin#2472
Go ahead broo

[05-May-20 01:12 PM] morochin#2472
I am just reading what I missed out üòÜ

[05-May-20 01:13 PM] mkhtop#4904
I guess we can just use the WhatsApp if there‚Äôs anything else to speak about after? üôÇ

[05-May-20 01:15 PM] Blnkspc#9267
OK cool me and Josh will get this sorted for it to be uploaded to the server @Emma12812  and we will let you know once it is ready...

[05-May-20 01:29 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@Emma12812 code is now in the master branch ready to be uploaded to the server. Can you then please let @mark know the URL for the index.php file so he can update the user guide before we continue closing down the repo.

[05-May-20 01:43 PM] mkhtop#4904
Perfect, will take me two secs to change the URL on the guides üôÇ

[06-May-20 11:00 AM] Emma12812#7942
Just finishing breakfast and I'll be on

[06-May-20 11:01 AM] Emma12812#7942
Just seen that message @Blnkspc I'll get that sorted

[06-May-20 01:21 PM] Emma12812#7942
Few problems with the web server almost finished working on it

[06-May-20 02:22 PM] mkhtop#4904
no problem let me know when you're ready üôÇ

[06-May-20 05:44 PM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone Sam's spent about 3 hours trying to sort out the website online and it's just not working. What other alternative do we have?

[06-May-20 06:31 PM] mkhtop#4904
Okay, I guess the only other option is to host it on the Edward 2 server? thank you and Sam for trying so hard! What does @everyone think?

[06-May-20 06:32 PM] morochin#2472
there was another team that hosted it in edward 2 server i think shouldnt be a problem!

[06-May-20 06:34 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I just tried getting on to my one but there's no connection

[06-May-20 07:17 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Edward2 might be a good shout but it will be worth asking Nick make sure he is OK with it?

[06-May-20 07:22 PM] Emma12812#7942
The only other option is to just give femi the program, instructions on how to install it correctly and just get him to run it locally but connected to our database still

[06-May-20 07:22 PM] Emma12812#7942
So he runs it just like we would in phpstorm?

[06-May-20 07:27 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@Emma12812 how was Sam trying to set it up on the server using XAMPP? or using phpstorm?

[06-May-20 07:28 PM] Emma12812#7942
He was using a custom docker container

[06-May-20 07:38 PM] Blnkspc#9267
containing?

[06-May-20 07:45 PM] Emma12812#7942
Its like a virtual machine

[06-May-20 07:45 PM] Blnkspc#9267
OK but what was he deploying in the docker container?

[06-May-20 07:46 PM] Emma12812#7942
Njinx

[06-May-20 08:02 PM] morochin#2472
why dont we email femi and ask his opinion?

[06-May-20 09:10 PM] Emma12812#7942
yeah ill email femi in the morning and ask his opinion

[07-May-20 09:56 AM] Emma12812#7942
@everyone I've emailed Femi

[07-May-20 09:58 AM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone OK I have made a guide of how to locally install it using XAMPP this is a free product. However I am going to need someone to test the instruction manual.

[07-May-20 10:21 AM] Blnkspc#9267
@Emma12812 Can you ask Sam if he is able to setup a docker container on his server containing XAMPP? As if he is able to then the guide on how to do a local installation should work on that.

[07-May-20 10:22 AM] Emma12812#7942
That's not possible because docker is based on Linux and xampp is a software package based on windows. His problem is he needs to generate an SSL certificate but it's not possible

[07-May-20 10:27 AM] Blnkspc#9267
OK cool.

[07-May-20 10:28 AM] Blnkspc#9267
Shame about the SSL thing as there is a Linux version of XAMPP.

[07-May-20 10:33 AM] Emma12812#7942
That still wouldn't work with docker unfortunately

[07-May-20 10:34 AM] Blnkspc#9267
That is fine it was worth asking the question.

[07-May-20 10:35 AM] Emma12812#7942
Yeah its a shame

[07-May-20 11:41 AM] Emma12812#7942

[07-May-20 11:41 AM] Emma12812#7942
Femis response

[07-May-20 12:01 PM] Blnkspc#9267
OK cool me and Josh have made a guide on how to install it using XAMPP and I think we will package that up this afternoon.

[07-May-20 12:08 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Then the test plan will need to be run on it before the final close down.

[07-May-20 12:08 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
I can do that soon

[07-May-20 12:09 PM] Emma12812#7942
Okay

[07-May-20 12:24 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
It all works fine

[07-May-20 12:24 PM] Blnkspc#9267
OK cool

[07-May-20 12:29 PM] mkhtop#4904
What shall I change on the user guide? Shall I just reference the doc you guys have written?

[07-May-20 01:32 PM] Emma12812#7942
thats what im thinking @mkhtop

[07-May-20 01:39 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Sounds like a good idea

[07-May-20 02:27 PM] mkhtop#4904
@everyone I have changed the user guides and ready to go

[07-May-20 02:46 PM] Emma12812#7942
Are we calling tomorrow to finalise?

[07-May-20 03:10 PM] Blnkspc#9267
Thank you @mkhtop

[07-May-20 03:25 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone what is the earliest time you can meet tomorrow?

[07-May-20 03:26 PM] JoshuaAB#9254
00:01 for me

[07-May-20 03:26 PM] Blnkspc#9267
For me 09:00

[07-May-20 03:31 PM] Emma12812#7942
I can meet from 10

[07-May-20 03:39 PM] mkhtop#4904
i can meet from 9 üôÇ

[07-May-20 03:40 PM] Blnkspc#9267
@everyone Lets call it and meet at 10am tomorrow.

[07-May-20 03:41 PM] mkhtop#4904
